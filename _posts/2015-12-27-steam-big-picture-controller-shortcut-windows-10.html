<p>Problem:</p>
<p>Installed Windows 10, installed steam, xbox button on controller doesn't open up Big Picture any more</p>
<p>Solution:</p>
<p>Need to disable DVR setting in the xbox application that comes with win10.</p>
<p>Can either login into the xbox app and disable the DVR option under settings, or if you can't login for some reason, you can press the windows key and g in any program, and select "this is a game", then turn off the dvr setting there.</p>
