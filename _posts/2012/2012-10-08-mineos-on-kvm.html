<div dir="ltr">So after about an hour of trying to work out why I couldn't see any ethernet adapters in my new Minecraft virtual machine, I eventually discovered that it's a problem with MineOS not supporting the para-virtualised network adapter that KVM provides. The fix for this was to change the adapter from virtio to e1000, for some reason rtl8139 doesn't work despite being pretty well supported.</div>
