<div dir="ltr">Finally got my Raspberry Pi today. Installation went surprisingly well, only issue was my complete lack of experience with Linux.</p>
<p>I wanted to try out a few different things with the RPi, the first of which was its&nbsp;feasibility&nbsp;as a thin client. After some quick googling I discovered rdesktop, a program to connect into windows remote desktop sessions.</p>
<p>Here was my first stumbling block, it seem that I needed root&nbsp;privileges&nbsp;to install things, and I had no idea what the password was. Turns out that's because there was no password, and I needed to set it using:</p>
<p>"sudo passwd root"</p>
<p>Ace.</p>
<p>So I installed rdesktop, ran it, and fairly painlessly logged into my windows remote desktop.<br />
The next issue was the program resolution, which I discovered can quite easily be changed by either specifying a percentage ("-g 90%") or using fullscreen ("-f") tags after the server location.</p>
<p>The raspberry pi itself, however, was not using the full resolution of the screen.</p>
<p>After yet more searching, I discovered that the correct mode can be found by typing</p>
<p>"/opt/vc/bin/tvservice &ndash;m DMT"</p>
<p>And finding the one that matches your resolution.<br />
This mode can then be added to /boot/config.txt (create it if it isn't there) as:</p>
<p>"hdmi_mode=58"</p>
<p>Changing 58 to your relevant mode found from the above list.</p>
<div>This, unfortunately, didn't solve anything, and I still had large black borders around my screen.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After some desperation, I finally added "disable_overscan = 1" to the config file, and low and behold, despite having no other overscan&nbsp;parameters&nbsp;defined, it worked!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Turns out either rdesktop or the RPi is quite laggy, so I'll be testing a few other programs next.</div>
