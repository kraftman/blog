<h4>Problem:</h4>
<p>Interface lag in linux mint when moving or resizing windows.</p>
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>Problem is caused by the theme needing equinox but it not being installed. MATE highlights this issue but cinnamon doesn't. Can be solved by either installing equinox, or change to a theme that doesn't need it.</p>
