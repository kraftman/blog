<h4>Problem:</h4>
<p>Docker supports passing in environment variables to your containers as a handy way to easily switch environments when using multiple docker-compose files. For example you may have a base docker-compose.yml with a docker-compose.dev.yml and docker-compose.prod.yml file that specify environment variables for database hostnames/credentials.<br />
The issue is simply accessing these environment variables directly isn't possible in openresty (e.g. using os.getenv()).</p>
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>The issue is caused by NGINX <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#env">blocking all environment variables</a> by default. To make them accessible again you need to re-define them in your nginx.conf, but with no values, e.g:</p>
<p>env APP_ENV;</p>
<p>You should then be able to access them as normal.</p>
