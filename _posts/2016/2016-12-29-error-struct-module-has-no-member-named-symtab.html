<h2>Problem:</h2>
<p>Running system tap gives the error: 'error: struct module has no member named "symtab"'</p>
<h2>Solution:</h2>
<p>This is caused by a bug with system tap not containing symtab for ubuntu 16+ in version 2.9, and can be solved by upgrading to systemtap 3.0+ by compiling from source.</p>
