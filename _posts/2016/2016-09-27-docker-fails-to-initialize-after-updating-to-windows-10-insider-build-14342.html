<h4>Problem:</h4>
<p>Docker for windows hates windows insider, it attempts to create a switch that already exists (DockerNAT) and then fails because it already exists.</p>
<h4>Solution:</h4>
<p>There are a few suggestions <a href="https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-fail-to-initialize-after-updating-to-windows-10-insider-build-14342/11896/2">here</a> but the one that worked for me was to open hyper v manager, then go to virtual switch manager, and rename the existing 'DockerNAT' switch to something else, then reinstall Docker.</p>
