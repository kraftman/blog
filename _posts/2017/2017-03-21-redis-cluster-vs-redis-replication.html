<p>While researching Redis Cluster I found a large number of tutorials on the subject that confused Replication and Cluster, with people setting up 'replication' using cluster but no slaves, or building a 'cluster' only consisting of master-slave databases with no cluster config.</p>
<p>So to clear things up:</p>
<h4>Replication</h4>
<p>Replication involves a master server which serves&nbsp;reads and writes, and duplicates all data to one or more slave servers (which serves reads but not writes). Slaves can be used to replace a master in case of failure, spread read request load, or to perform backups of the database to reduce load on the master.</p>
<h4>Cluster</h4>
<p>Clusters are used when you have more data than RAM in a single machine: the data is automatically split (based on the key) across multiple databases, increasing the amount of data you can store. Clients requesting a key from any cluster node will be redirected to the node holding the key, and are expected to learn the locations of keys to reduce the number of redirects.</p>
<h4>Replicaton + Cluster</h4>
<p>Redis Cluster supports replication by adding slaves to existing nodes, if a master becomes unreachable then its slave will be promoted to master.</p>
<h4>Sentinel</h4>
<p>Last but not least, Redis Sentinel can be used to manage replicated servers (not clustered, see below.) Clients connect to a Sentinel and request a master or slave to communicate with, the sentinels handle health checks of the masters/slaves, and will automatically promote a slave if a master is unreachable. You need to have at least 3 sentinels running so that they can agree on reachability of nodes, and to ensure the sentinels aren't a single point of failure.</p>
<p>Cluster handles its own promotion and does not need Sentinel in front of it.</p>
