<p>This is just a quick update on the previous post about monitoring zabbix, and assumes you already have zabbix set up and monitoring the basic properties of your server. (if you don't, <a title="MC DDOS protection part 3: Monitoring" href="http://itschr.is/?p=176">see here</a>.)</p>
<p>We're going to add a simple php script on our minecraft server that queries the number of players online, then return this value to the zabbix server by adding it ot the agent as a UserParameter.</p>
<h2>Adding the PHP:</h2>
<p>No point in reinventing the wheel, so we're going to grab &nbsp;xPaw's MinecraftQuery.class.php <a href="https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query">from here</a>&nbsp;and save it on the minecraft server as "MinecraftQuery.class.php"<a href="https://github.com/xPaw/PHP-Minecraft-Query/blob/master/MinecraftQuery.class.php"><br />
</a></p>
<p>Then we need to add our own file which uses this one, queries our server ip and port, and returns the number:</p>
<blockquote><p><?php<br />
require_once('MineCraftQuery.class.php');</p>
<p>$Query = new MinecraftQuery( );</p>
<p>try<br />
{<br />
//$arg[1] is the argument passed in when calling the php, in this case the port<br />
$Query->Connect( '127.0.0.1', $argv[1] );</p>
<p>$result = $Query->GetInfo( );</p>
<p>echo $result["Players"];<br />
}<br />
catch( MinecraftQueryException $e )<br />
{<br />
//return 0 if something goes wrong<br />
echo 0;<br />
}</p>
<p>unset($Query);<br />
unset($result);<br />
?></p></blockquote>
<p>Now we add a custom user parameter to the bottom of /etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.conf :</p>
<blockquote><p>UserParameter=minecraft.players[*],php /home/mc/ServerQuery.php $1</p></blockquote>
<p>The first part is the key to identify the item in zabbix server: the * in brackets tells the agent to use the values that the server is sending in place of any numbers prepended with $. This means with a single UserParameter on the agent, we can query multiple minecraft servers from the zabbix server, simply by passing a different port in with the trigger. The second part is the command to run our script, change it to match your script's path.</p>
<p>Finally, on the server we need to reload the zabbix agent so it know about the new key:</p>
<blockquote><p>/etc/init.d/zabbix-agent restart</p></blockquote>
<h2>Adding the Host Item</h2>
<p>In the zabbix web interface, go to configuration -> Hosts, select your minecraft server and go to Item -> Create Item.</p>
<p>For the key, enter the key you used as a UserParamter, but replace the * with the server query port.</p>
<p>Thats all you need to do to add the item, but to make it a bit neater you can set the Units to "players" and create a new application group such as "minecraft players"</p>
<p>Here's mine:</p>
<p><a href="http://itschr.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Capture5.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-197" alt="Capture" src="http://itschr.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Capture5.png" width="584" height="781" /></a></p>
<p>Repeat the above for any extra servers you have, and add all of the items to a graph to display them together (see part 1 for more on graphs) You should end up with something like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://itschr.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Capture6.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-207" alt="Capture" src="http://itschr.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Capture6.png" width="819" height="416" /></a></p>
<p>To link externally to your graphs you need to enable guest readonly access, and use the following address:</p>
<p>http://mydomain.com/zabbix/chart2.php?graphid=<graphID></p>
<p>(you can find the graph ID in the URL when you are configuring the graph)</p>
