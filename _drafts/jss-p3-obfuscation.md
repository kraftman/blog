The key to job security is code complexity.

Obfuscate your code

lets say function A calls function B. Why not pass it through function C first? That way you hide the link between A and B

the goal is to make sure there's a barrier to entry to anyone new coming in and being able to work on the code

other tips:
- use inheritance as much as possible
- use index.js to people cant find files
